# SimpleWorldchat
Simple World chat is a simple world chat management plugin. It keeps all the player's chat in the world their currently in. If there is no-one else in the world, it tells them "No one can hear you!".

There is also a bypass command "/chat bypass" so that people with the permission wordchat.bypass can chat in all worlds
